        "During my time at university, which specializes in computer science, I acquired a set of essential skills that every successful programmer and developer should possess. I deeply learned programming, which helped me develop logical thinking and efficiently solve problems. My university experience was not limited to academics; I also joined several scientific clubs where I had the opportunity to enhance my teamwork and communication skills. Through these experiences, I learned the art of presentation and public speaking, which increased my ability to express my ideas with confidence and clarity. All these experiences contributed to building my professional character and prepared me to face real-world challenges.",
